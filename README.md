# Spam-Ham Classification

This repository contains a binary logistic regression classifier designed to discern spam emails from non-spam (ham) emails. It was developed as part of the DATA 100 course at UC Berkeley, showcasing the practical application of machine learning techniques.

## Key Objectives
- Implement a binary logistic regression model for spam detection.
- Employ feature engineering to extract meaningful attributes from email text data.
- Utilize Scikit-learn for model building, training, and validation.
- Apply cross-validation to ensure model robustness and minimize overfitting.
- Generate precision-recall curves to evaluate the classifier's performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for analysis within Jupyter notebooks.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for Python, used for model fitting and evaluation.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Visualization libraries employed for creating precision-recall curves and other data visualizations.

## Files in Repository
- `projB1.ipynb`: Initial exploration and model development notebook.
- `projB2.ipynb`: Advanced modeling and evaluation notebook.

## Conclusion
This spam classification project illustrates the use of advanced data science techniques to address the real-world issue of email filtering. The successful deployment of this classifier has the potential to significantly improve email management and security.
