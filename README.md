# Spam-classification
- In this project for DATA 100 at UC Berkeley, I have designed and developed a binary logistic regression classifier capable of accurately distinguishing spam (junk, commercial, or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails.

- The project utilizes feature engineering techniques on text data extracted from emails. Scikit-learn libraries are employed for data processing and model fitting, while cross-validation is implemented to minimize overfitting. To assess the classifier's performance, precision-recall curves are generated and analyzed.

- In addition to Python, which is used within a Jupyter notebook, I have leveraged Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualizations, and Scikit-learn libraries for various machine-learning tasks throughout this project.

Overall, this endeavor demonstrates the application of sophisticated techniques to effectively tackle the challenging problem of spam classification in emails.
